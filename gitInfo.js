    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does.

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitDefinition = 'Git is used as a version control program. It lets you save your work whenever and revert back to it if needed.

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitHubDefinition = 'GitHub is a platform for storing and sharing your git repos. It lets others view and download your work, as well as allowing them to contribute to your code.';
//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 8////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'add' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the add command.
*/

//CODE HERE
let add = {
    description: 'git add allows you to add untracked files and changes to tracked files to the git repo',
