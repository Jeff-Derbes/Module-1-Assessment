let planning = 'In this stage, a plan is established that outlines objectives and methods that will be used to complete the project at a high level. This is usually done in cooperation with the client to figure out what the end goals are for the project.'

let analysisOfRequirements = 'During the analysis stage, a determination is made on what specific tools and resources will be required for the project.'

let design = 'In the design stage, the overall architecture of the project is created. The design can include the tech stack that will be used and defining how each part of the stack will be implemented.'

let implementation = 'The implementation is the actual development of the software. Developers take the design plans and use them to create the application.'

let testingAndIntegration = 'Testing and integration take the product created during the implementation stage and tests each aspect and feature for full functionality. After testing is completed, the product is officially deployed.'

let maintain = 'After the product has been deployed, it will require regular updating and maintaining as new hardware or dependent software changes or is updated.'
